import { Code } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

## Quick start

For best results install via `yarn` or `npm`:

export const example1 = `
yarn add cwf-lite --dev
`;

<Code code={example1} />

export const example2 = `
npm install cwf-lite -D
`;

<Code code={example2} />

### Import

Once installed, import the source css file from `node_modules/cwf-lite/dist/index.css` into your projects css file:

export const example3 = `
@import "cwf-lite/dist/index.css";
`;

<Code code={example3} lang="css" />

<hr />

## Advanced

### Import individual css files

If you would rather pick and choose which css files you want to import then you can. Bear in mind that _cwf-lite_ uses postcss meaning that you will need to include this in your build process.

export const example4 = `
@import "cwf-lite/style/module/alert.css";
@import "cwf-lite/style/module/input.css";
@import "cwf-lite/style/utilities/margin.css";
`;

<Code code={example4} lang="css" />

### Importing in JavaScript

If you really wanted you could import the uncompiled css into your JavaScript. You would still need to include postcss in your package.

export const example5 = `
import "cwf-lite/style.css";
`;

<Code code={example5} lang="css" />
