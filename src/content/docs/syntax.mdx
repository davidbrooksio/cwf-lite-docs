## Block Element Modifier

_cwf-lite_ uses BEM (Block Element Modifier) as a naming convention. Here's an example of what a CSS developer writing in the BEM style might write:

export const example1 = `
/* Block component */
.btn {}

/* Element that depends upon the block */ 
.btn__price {}

/* Modifier that changes the style of the block */
.btn--orange {} 
.btn--big {}
`;

<Code code={example1} lang="css" />

In this CSS methodology a **block** is a top-level abstraction of a new component, for example a button: `.btn { }`.
This block should be thought of as a parent. Child items, or **elements**, can be placed inside and these are denoted by two underscores following the name of the block like `.btn__price { }`.
Finally, **modifiers** can manipulate the block so that we can theme or style that particular component without inflicting changes on a completely unrelated module.
This is done by appending two hyphens to the name of the block just like `btn--orange`.

The markup might then look like this:

export const example2 = `
<a class="btn btn--big btn--orange" href="/">
  <span class="btn__price">$9.99</span>
  <span class="btn__text">Subscribe</span>
</a>
`;

<Code code={example2} lang="html" />

## CSS variables

_cwf-lite_ uses css variables with default fallbacks such as:

export const example3 = `
.elementclass {
  background-color: var(--element-background-color, white);
}
`;

<Code code={example3} lang="css" />

In this example, the browser would first look to see if a variable of `--element-background-color` has been set.
if it has then that is what will be shown, if it hasn't then the `background-color` will fallback to `white`.
