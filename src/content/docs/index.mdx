### Why cwf-lite?

_cwf-lite_ is a great starting point for your project. It offers a standardised set of classes to bring structure to the page.
_cwf-lite_ has been created to offer a basis on which you build your custom css, making your projects the main focus and not the framework.
With this in mind, _cwf-lite_ is **never** intended for use _as is_ and in reality it won't look too great without creating a custom css layer for your project.

Think of _cwf-lite_ as the css foundation for your project, on which you must build your custom design.
